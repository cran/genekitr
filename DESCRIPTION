Description: An analysis toolkit focused on genes. It mainly includes five
    features (search, convert, analysis, plot, and export).
    The user just needs to input feature id ('entrez', 'symbol', 'ensembl' or
    'uniprot') to retrieve feature information and PubMed records, to convert id
    types, to easily do enrichment analysis and draw publication-level plots of GO,
    KEGG and GSEA, to plot group interaction and export results as sheets in one excel
    file to easily share and communicate with others.
