Description: An analysis toolkit based on gene. It mainly includes five 
    features (search, transform, analysis, visualization and export).
    User just needs to provide gene id ('entrez', 'symbol' or 'ensembl') then can 
    search gene related information, transform id type, do enrichment analysis,
    visualize enrichment result, visualized multi-group Venn diagram and export
    result as excel sheets to easily share and communicate with others.
